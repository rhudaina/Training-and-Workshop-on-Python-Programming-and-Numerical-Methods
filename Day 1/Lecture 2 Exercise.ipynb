    "Consider the dataset biomass.txt. In the Taita Hills in Kenya, a citizen-science project was set up to assess the affect of forest degradation on ground-dwelling invertebrate biomass. Citizens were asked to place invertebrate traps at “random” locations in forests. After a few days, the traps were emptied by the citizens and the biomass of the captured invertebrates was quantified by a biologist. The outcome of interest is a standardized biomass variable (biomass). Forest degradation was assessed by the citizens, based on a visual survey, that scored multiple aspects of the forest (type of trees, signs of logging, littering, etc.) Based on this, a variable degradation was defined (0: pristine, 1: moderate degradation, 2: severe degradation). The variable days represents the number of days before the trap 1. was emptied."
